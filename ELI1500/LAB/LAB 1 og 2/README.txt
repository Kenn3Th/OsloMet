This exercises was based on a main road with a crossing side road and a pedestrian crossing.

I used interrupt function and switcs cases to code this.
Fotgjenger.ino contains the interrupt function and the case for the pedestrian.
Vei_B.ino contain the interrupt function and the case for the crossing road.
Start.ino contains the default setting for the main road.
