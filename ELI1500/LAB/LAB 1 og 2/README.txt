This exercises was based on a main road with a crossing side road and a pedestrian crossing.

I used interrupt function and switcs cases to code this.

*** Code ***
Lyskryss.ino    - is the main function.
Fotgjenger.ino  - contains the interrupt function and the case for the pedestrian.
Vei_B.ino       - contain the interrupt function and the case for the crossing road.
Start.ino       - contains the default setting for the main road.

*** products used ***
- Arduino Uno   - Wires
- Green LED     - 330 Ohm's resistor
- Red LED       - button's
- Yellow LED
